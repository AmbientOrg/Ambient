# Introduction

Kiwi Runtime provides a programming environment for building high performance games and 3d applications.

## Getting started

To create a project, first run;

```sh
kiwi new my-project
```

This will generate a new project for you. You can immediately run it:

```sh
cd my-project
kiwi run
```

From here on, you can open up the project in your favorite IDE and start editing the code.
