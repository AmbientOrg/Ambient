# Installing

Installing Ambient for development purposes is easy, just follow these three steps:

1. [Install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
2. Add the wasm32 toolchain: `rustup target add --toolchain stable wasm32-wasi`
3. Install ambient: `cargo install ambient`

Step 2. and 3. are commands that you need to paste into your terminal of choice.

Ambient currently runs on Windows, Linux and Mac.

Next, try the steps in [getting started](./getting_started.md) to create your first Ambient project.
