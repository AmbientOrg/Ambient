# Project

All Ambient projects must have an `ambient.toml` project manifest that describes their functionality. This format is in flux, but is inspired by Rust's `Cargo.toml`.

At present, dependencies are _not_ supported, but this will change in future.

## Reference

The full structure for `ambient.toml` is shown below with a sample:

<!-- TODO: autogenerate with generate-docs -->

```toml
{{#include ambient.sample.toml}}
```
