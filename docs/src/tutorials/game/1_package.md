# Chapter 1 Creating a package

To start a new ambient project, type the following in your terminal of choice:

```sh
ambient new my_project
```

This will create a new ambient package.

> A package is a bundle of code and assets which can be deployed. Read more about packages [here](../../reference/package.md).

Enter the project folder by typing `cd my_project`, and then try running it with:

```sh
ambient run
```

You should see a simple scene in front of you now, which looks like this:

![Ambient window](template.png)

Among the console output of ambient you should see a line that says something like:

```
Proxy allocated an endpoint, use `ambient join proxy-eu.ambient.run:9898` to join
```

This can be used to quickly test a multiplayer game; just copy the text in green and run it in another terminal window,
or even on another machine.

## Package structure

The basic structure of package is as follows:

- `my_package/`
  - `assets/` _This folder contains all assets_
    - `pipeline.json` _A pipeline file decides how the assets will be processsed, [read more here](../../reference/asset_pipeline.md)_
  - `src/` _This folder contains all source code_
    - `client.rs` _This file contains the code that run on your players computers_
    - `server.rs` _This file contains code that runs on the game server_
  - `ambient.toml` _This is where you define ECS components, messages and other data about your package_
  - `Cargo.toml` _This is Rusts equivalent of `ambient.toml`, which defines Rust-specific package things such as Rust dependencies`_

> You can read more about ECS [here](../../reference/ecs.html).

## Server and client?

Ambient is build to be multiplayer by default, which is why each new package comes with a `server.rs` and `client.rs`. You typically define
game logic on the server, whereas the client forwards inputs and adds visual effects.

## IDE setup

If you have installed all the [recommended VS Code tools](../../user/setting_up_ide.md), you should be able to hover your mouse over each concept or component to see the docs:

This will also give you auto-completion and a few other handy tools.

> Tip: Use `ctrl-.` (windows, or `cmd-.` on osx) to bring up VSCode suggestions, such as help to automatically import dependencies

## Challenge

Try to create some cubes and change their `translation()`, `scale()`, `rotation()` components.

> Tip: You can refer to the [primitives example](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/blob/main/guest/rust/examples/basics/primitives/src/server.rs) in the Ambient main GitHub repository.
