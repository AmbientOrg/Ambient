# Chapter 7: Publishing your game

So you've got a small game going now and want to send it to a friend. How do we do that?

Easy! All you need to do is run:

```
ambient deploy
```

> Note: The first time you run it it will prompt you to create a user account and to register your api token

Once your game is deployed, you can just go to the URL provided and play it from there. You can send the URL
to a friend, and they can join you there as well!

> Tip: For more deployment options, see the [docs on distributing](../../reference/distributing.md).

> Tip: Deploying with `ambient deploy` will deploy to the Ambient servers. But you can also use your own game servers
> you'd like. See the [docs on distributing](../../reference/distributing.md) for more info.
