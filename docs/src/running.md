To create a project, run:

```sh
ambient new my-project

This will generate a new project with a simple Rust module and an Ambient project manifest.

## Running a project

This project can be run:

```sh
cd my-project

From here on, you can open up the project in your favorite IDE and start editing the code. If you require a recommendation for an IDE, see [Setting up your IDE](#setting-up-your-ide).
