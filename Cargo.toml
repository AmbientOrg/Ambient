# Group 1: show the UI
# This include the aiming cross in the middle of the screen
# Use TAB key to toggle the scoreboard
# The "Rule" mod provides the calculation for player's score/health, etc.
# It's also the foundation of the future animation mod
# When the player health changes, "Hit" or "Death" animation will be triggered
