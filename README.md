Tilt Runtime provides a programming environment for building high performance games and 3d applications.

Our goal is to provide a free and Open source game development API/runtime which can be accessed from any language, which can be run on as many platforms as possible and which is multiplayer native. Since Tilt is powered by WASM, modules built on Tilt are always safe to run, both on your own game servers and on your clients machines.

We're also developing https://tilt.place, which will allow you to host and distribute your Tilt projects with ease.

See the [documentation](./docs/index.md) for a getting started guide.

## Roadmap & features

***Note; Tilt is in an alpha stage and the API will still be iterated on heavily. We're working towards a stable release.***
