Kiwi is a WebAssembly runtime for building high-performance online games and 3d applications.

Features:

- **Seamless networking**: Kiwi is both your server and client. You just need to build your server and/or client side logic, the runtime handles synchronization of data for you.
- **Isolation**: Packages you build for Kiwi are executed in isolation, which means that even if something crashes, it won‚Äôt take down your entire program. It also means that you can run untrusted code safely.
- **Data oriented design**: The core data model of Kiwi is an ECS which each ‚Äúprocess‚Äù can manipulate.
- **Multi-lingual**: You will be able to build Kiwi modules in any language which compiles to WebAssembly. Rust is the only supported language yet, but we‚Äôre working on expanding to other languages.
- **Single executable**: The Kiwi Runtime is a single executable which runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. It can act as a server, or as a client, in which case it renders your game world for you.
- **Interoperability**: We‚Äôve designed a way for you to define ‚Äúcomponent schemas‚Äù, which makes it possible to share data between Kiwi modules, even if they don‚Äôt explicitly know about each other.
- **Asset pipeline & streaming**: The runtime supports building and loading multiple file formats, such as .glb and .fbx. The assets are always streamed over the network.
- **Powerful renderer**: The Kiwi renderer is ‚Äúgpu driven‚Äù, with culling and lodding happening on the gpu side. It‚Äôs PBR by default, supports cascading shadow maps, and instances everything that can be instanced.

We're also developing https://kiwi.place, which will allow you to host and distribute your Kiwi projects with ease.

See the [documentation](./docs) for a getting started guide.

## Installing

```sh
cargo install kiwi
```

See [installing](./docs/src/installing.md) for more details.

## Roadmap

**_Note; Kiwi is in an alpha stage and the API will still be iterated on heavily. We're working towards a stable release._**

## Examples

Each example in the [examples](./examples/) directory can be run with the kiwi runtime: `cd examples/hello_world` and then `kiwi run`.
They can also be run in multiplayer mode; `cd examples/tictactoe` and then `kiwi serve` to start a serve. Anyone can now join
with `kiwi join [IP_OF_SERVER]`. Note that content is always streamed so the user joining only needs the kiwi cli to join the session.
