# Hide cursor

This package will lock and hide the cursor when nothing is focused (i.e. no UI element is focused).
It will also react to the "Escape" key being pressed, in which case it will set focus to "Nothing",
which in turn will turn off cursor locking and hiding.

You usually use this package in conjunction with something like the `fps_controller` package.
